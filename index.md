Things that are interesting to me in the coding area:

-- jekyll and github pages.

-- esp32 and mongoose-os.

-- arduino. 

-- docker

-- [papercraft spectrometer](https://github.com/sctv/papercraft-spectrometer)

-- eForth on the [w1209](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/wiki/Board-W1209)

-- getting programs to run on rPi [sometimes I even have to build them!]

-- projects that use the above 
 
  like 
  
  [DED](http://github.com/sctv/ded "ded")
  
  and the captured beach portal
