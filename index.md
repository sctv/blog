title: SCTV - a code repository for Brian Degger 
---
Things that atre interesting to me in the coding area:

-- jekyll and github pages.

-- esp32 and mongoose-os.

-- arduino. 

-- getting programs to run on rPi [sometimes I even have to build them!]

-- projects that use the above 
 
  like 
  
  [DED](http://github.com/sctv/ded "ded")
  
  and the captured beach portal
