<h1> History of a/the Makerspace </h1>
<p> Makerspace.co.uk was registeres in 18th May 2010. Our first mailinglist (North East Makers) started March 31st 2011,     
Apparently Brian and Alistair first suggested the idea of turning "MakerSpace" into Newcastle's first hack space on the 4th July 2011

<p>
  We had our first welcome Wednesday on the 20th July http://www.makerspace.org.uk/blog/2011/07/maker-spaces-first-drop-in-session-july-20th/ 
 the 11th is prodding some part of the back of my brain for some reason
